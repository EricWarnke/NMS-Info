## Adding into to the repository

If you're adding information to the repo, use the [generator](http://secretonline.github.io/NMS-Info/generator.html) to ensure proper formatting.

In previous versions it was important that you added to the end of the file. Now it is no longer as important. In order to keep things consistent, I ask that you still add to the end of the file.

The [info dump](http://secretonline.github.io/NMS-Info/infodump.html) can be used to quickly dump all of the information, which can help with grammar and spelling checking.
